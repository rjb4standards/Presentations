<h1>Introduction</h1>

My name is Dick Brooks and I recently took an early retirement from ISO New England, http://www.iso-ne.com where I served as a Technical Lead on the ISO's Business Intelligence Platform (OBIEE) and indeed built the platform from scratch, starting in 2010 and have navigated its expansion over the years. I successfully introduced the R language into ISO New England in 2015 and have supported its expanded use in Operations and other areas of the Company, including Market Monitoring. Prior to my retirement, I served as the Technical Lead/SCRUM Master for the design and development of ISO New England's Market Monitoring Advanced Analytics Data Mart project, which is used by market analysts to seek out anomalous behavior in the energy markets (DA, RT, FTR, etc.)
