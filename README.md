Dick is the lead software engineer responsible for REA's software product, the <a href="https://reliableenergyanalytics.com/products"> Software Assurance Guardian (TM) Point Man (TM) (SAG-PM)(TM) software</a>, a software supply chain risk assessment and management platform for the verification of software integrity and authenticity applying NIST Cybersecurity Framework guidelines to augment NERC CIP-010-3 R1, Part 1.6 as suggested by FERC in their 6/18/2020 White Paper, see docket AD20-19-000. A trust score, called a SAGScore (similar to a FICO score), provides Companies with a trustworthiness score for software objects before any attempt to install a software object in a computing system, affording a Company the opportunity to make a risk based decision to install, or not install, a software object. Version 1.1.0 of SAG-PM(TM) containing full support for NTIA supported SBOM formats, SPDX and CycloneDX was released on April 30, 2021, <a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/accesswire/electric-utilities-technology-utilities-business-software-9105f3b96fdae5cd11aac660d44a69e1">the SAG-PM(TM) V1.1.0 press release is available here</a>. REA continues to implement C-SCRM best practices to protect the software supply chain, in accordance with the May 12, 2021 Cybersecurity Executive Order emphasizing the use of SBOM for C-SCRM product-centric risk assessments. <a href="https://www.einpresswire.com/article/545051889/announcing-the-sag-ctr-tm-community-trust-registry-for-digitally-signed-software?r=pawKHGm9JeOss4tpbO">The recent announcement of SAG-CTR(TM) the Community Trust Registry</a> for the SAG-PM(TM) user community enables parties to register their trust in a spcific software package and digital signature combination, forming a bonded trust relationship, which other SAG-PM(TM) users can query. The more "trusting parties" the higher the Trustworthiness level. Software packages that receive a critical mass of trust declarations are eligible to receive the SAG-STAR(TM) label, indicating the highest degree of community trust. 
The SAG-PM (TM) software currently stands at  <a href="https://reliableenergyanalytics.com/products">version 1.2 with full support for OMB M-22-18 requirements for NIST Guidance to satisfy Executive Order 14028</a>
